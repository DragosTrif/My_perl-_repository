#One of the first programs many people write is a lottery number generator â€“ to
#generate six random integers between 1 and 50. A Perl lottery program can use the
#function rand to get a pseudo-random number. This function generates a number
#between zero and its first argument, for example rand 1234 will give a number
#between zero and 1234. Unfortunately, the numbers it returns are double precision.
#Easy so far? Remember that you need six numbers, and that you could call rand
#six times but get the same number more than once (there are many possible
#solutions to this).
#Print out your six numbers in sorted order, with a space between each, for example:
#1 8 12 27 30 34
#We have only shown how to do a textual sort so far, to sort numerically use:
#sort {$a<=>$b} (some-list);
